                <h2>How TRVL started</h2>
                <p>Prior to starting Tourism Tiger, I worked in the SEO and social media sectors of tourism marketing, first for Australia’s largest SEO agency and then as an independent consultant.
                    <p>No matter the client, the story always followed the same lines: tour operators had a website that was several years old and making changes was difficult, impossible, or far too expensive.
                        That wasn’t even the worst of it: all of these sites were gradually falling out of date, with no way to stop it! New technologies would come out, but which new feature made it worthwhile building a whole new website for? Something finally clicked…
                    </p>Why should a tourism website need a total rebuild every time a new change comes along? Why would a web designer wait for a client to request certain updates rather than anticipating that need? Why don’t tour & travel web design agencies have support teams dedicated to making all those necessary little changes? What happens to a client’s existing website when a web designer learns a new trick to make websites more effective?</p>

                <p>And so, Tourism Tiger was born. My wife Rebeca and I hit the ground running in January 2015 with a mission to build great websites for tour and activity operators that are effective from day 1 and STAY effective in the years that follow. Rebeca’s design skills and my expertise in tourism marketing and SEO proved the perfect combination to get Tourism Tiger off the ground.                In January of 2018 – almost 3 years to the day since Tourism Tiger sold its first website – we made a decision. The company was growing so quickly that we wanted to make sure we had a team in place to help take it to the next level. Rebeca and I were moving back to Australia and now was the time to hand over the reins. We had to make sure we were leaving the company in the hands of people who truly understand Tourism Tiger and shared our vision for the future and we found that in Russel and Simon.
                    <p>Those two – along with their fantastic (and ever expanding) team – have helped to build on what Rebeca and I set out to do in those early days. Crucially, our goal has remained the same – to help your tours or activities business thrive. We know that people book your tours from all over the world. We know your website is the face of your business. We aim to put your best foot forward, emphasizing the value of your tours and experiences, highlighting what sets your company apart, and presenting it all in a clear, appealing, and user-friendly way. Let us continue to focus on the technical stuff so that you can focus on giving your customers an unforgettable experience.
